Description: A unified interface is provided to various machine learning
  algorithms like LDA, QDA, k-nearest neighbour, LVQ, random forest, SVM, ... It
  allows to train, test, and apply cross-validation using similar functions and
  function arguments with a minimalist and clean, formula-based interface.
  Missing data are threated the same way as base and stats R functions for all
  algorithms, both in training and testing. Confusion matrices are also provided
  with a rich set of metrics calculated and a few specific plots.
