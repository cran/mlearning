Title: Machine Learning Algorithms with Unified Interface and Confusion
        Matrices
Description: A unified interface is provided to various machine learning
  algorithms like linear or quadratic discriminant analysis, k-nearest
  neighbors, random forest, support vector machine, ... It allows to train,
  test, and apply cross-validation using similar functions and function
  arguments with a minimalist and clean, formula-based interface. Missing data
  are processed the same way as base and stats R functions for all algorithms,
  both in training and testing. Confusion matrices are also provided with a rich
  set of metrics calculated and a few specific plots.
